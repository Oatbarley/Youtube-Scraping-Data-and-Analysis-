## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a project developed as part of the **CPE312 Introduction to Data Science** course. The project focuses on **data scraping and analysis of YouTube channels** with the objective of identifying insights from video performance and engagement.

Two YouTube channels were analyzed:
- 🎬 [One LC](https://www.youtube.com/@onelc)
- 👻 [Lorndiary (หลอนไดอารี่)](https://www.youtube.com/@lorndiary)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **data scraping** from YouTube, extracting metrics such as views, likes, comments, and publish dates.
- Conduct **comparative analysis** between channels to identify:
  - Popular content categories
  - Posting frequency and engagement trends
  - Performance differences between the two channels
- Apply Python-based **data science and visualization techniques** to extract actionable insights.
